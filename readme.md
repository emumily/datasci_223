Hi I'm Emily and I'm the TA for this Applied DS in Python course

Exercise files mostly consist of rough attempts at homework and other demo code. Current plan is to work on a project with GNN or NLP for recommendation systems, either in healthcare or user problems and product sense once I have more time

Exercises can be found in `exercises/`
